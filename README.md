# STM32 Buisnesscard Manelbrot Explorer
## This project is actively in progress!
## Description
This card will be powered by 4 zink air batteries (cost effective & high enough discharge) and will allow exploration of the mandelbrot fractal. Cost per card is projected to be about 7$, although I'm spending a lot more money learning. 
A cheaper MCU could be used, but I decided to go with something that has a developed ecosystem to save time. If you'd like to see software built from the ground up, without any HAL, see my wristwatch project.
## Directories
The recon folder are just some experiments I ran to get familiar with STM32.
I've finished the schematic (see kicad folder), I'm now working on the PCB. It will likely be finished after the career fair.
